<h1><center>CCC Rules</h1>
  <p>In this version of (sort of) Dungeons and Dragons, the GM will not be playing as a character.  Instead, it will just be up to the three adventurers,
  and it makes it a lot easier for me to run the game without having to worry about my character.  The reason why it will be easier is because in this version,
  the adventurers will be playing in character.  You will be coming up with a personality for your character, and your actions are limited to what your character
  would do.  For example, if your character were to want to kill one of your allies for no reason, you cannot do that.  Your character would have to be very angry,
  be insane, or some other reason.  Your characters are also going to be one of six different classes.  These classes are listed below, with five skills associated
  with them.  You must select three of these.  You will have these skills, and only these skills, for the remainder of the campaign.  Each of these skills will cost
  "Stamina."  Stamina encompasses your health and mana from the previous campaign.  Each character has a maximum of 30 stamina, which can be restored through various
  means.  This amount may be adjusted if I decide that it's too much or too little.  Other than that, do what you want to in this campaign.  While there is a set story,
  there is nothing stopping you from doing whatever you want in this game, with a couple of exceptions that you will see in the game.</p>
