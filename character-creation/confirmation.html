			<p1><center>This website is hosted on GitHub. Because GitHub does not support PHP, this form is unable to be sent in an email, effectively making it useless.<br>
			Here is a <a href="http://danelerh.byethost17.com/">link</a> to this same website, hosted by Byethost, which does support PHP.<br>
			It doesn't matter, though, as the PHP file still doesn't work properly, so the only difference is a blank page instead of this one.</p1>
